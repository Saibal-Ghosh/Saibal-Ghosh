                                                  Hi there 👋

I'm Saibal Ghosh, a Senior Data Analyst & a Database Professional and currently a 2x Kaggle Expert (Notebooks & Discussion).

Having been associated with data and various databases (SQL, Oracle, Sybase, MongoDB .. ) all throughout the career - it really amazes how the data have grown drastically & the variety have changed over the decade.
So, the good thing was the learning never stopped - with every passing year and with new things/technologies evoloving remained motivated to learn them and also mentoring the juniors in the journey.

My key interest always have been playing & exploring the data and still continue to do that.
Also passionate about creating ML/AI based products
